						<strong>
							2007–2008: Early career
						</strong>
						<p class="tribute-info-text">
							Tame Impala emerged in 2007 as a Kevin Parker home-recording project in this period and he posted a number
							of tracks on Myspace. This brought interest from a number of labels and eventually, he signed a
							worldwide
							deal with the independent Modular Recordings in July 2008. <br> To transfer these recordings to a
							live-stage,
							Parker enlisted the help of Dominic Simper (bass) and Jay Watson (drums) and began playing at some local
							gigs.
